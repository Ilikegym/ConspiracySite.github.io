		<b><h1 id = "history">History</h1></b>
		<p>
			In my many adventures to find the truth I found an old mansion in a small 
			<br>town in France, it was so old that no matter who I asked no one knew 
			<br>when was it built or who owned it. After a lot of thinking(it was like 10 
			<br>seconds) I decided the best thing to do is to break inside the mansion 
			<br>and see what it has to offer. The mansion itself was pretty boring but I did 
			<br>find there a weird book that talks about some kind of an ancient 
			<!--Secret Link-->
			<a href = "DO_NOT_ENTER/Secret11.html" style = "color:#880808;">cult</a>
			,this 
			<br>was the first time I ever heard about the cult of Cthulhu.
			<br>The cult is very ancient, so ancient in fact that I am pretty sure it existed 
			<img src = "Images/CthuluPageImages/Creepy.jpg" alt = "Image of the owner of the mansion" title = "Painting Of The Mansion's Onwer">
			<br>even before the earth was created. But, the cult is not only ancient but 
			<br>also very global, in my research I found at least 10 bases they have in the 
			<br>countries: Iceland, China, France, Romania, Lebanon, Morocco, Kenya, 
			<br>Angola, chile, and the USA. Not only this but I estimate that they have 
			<br>at least 120 million members, most of them from the lower class, people 
			<br>who have been left to die by the world but  some members are people
			<br>a lot of power and influence over the world. You can find 
			<br>with a list of them <a href = #members>here</a>.

		<img src = "Images/CthuluPageImages/GreatOldOnes1.png" alt = "Image of Eldrakon" title = "Eldrakon The Great Old One Of Chaos">
		<p>
			The cult is very secret, and no matter how much I tried I couldn't find a 
			<br>way to join them but I did find a person named "Ziv" who was a member 
			<br>of the cult. I will not tell you what I did to him to make him speak or 
			<br> how did I found him but I will tell you about some of the interesting 
			<br>things he told me about them.
			<br>The creators of the cult were a group of gods named the Great Old Ones. 
			<br>They came from another universe, the reason why they came to our 
			<br>universe is unknown even for the cult. Maybe their universe was 
			<br>destroyed or maybe they had to run from something, but no matter what 
			<br>happened the result was that they moved to our universe and made Earth
			<img src = "Images/CthuluPageImages/GreatOldOnes2.png" alt = "Image of Az'ghor" title = "Az'ghor The Great Old One Of Knowledge">
			<br>their new home. On Earth, to avoid the lizard people who already lived on 
			<br>Earth, the Great Old Ones created a city in the middle of the Atlantic 
			<br>Ocean far far away from the lizard people, if you have yet to understand 
			<br>this city is the ancient city of Atlantis.
			<br>For years the Great Old Ones lived in peace with the lizard people as they 
			<br>didn't have any 
			<!--Secret Link-->
			<a href = "DO_NOT_ENTER/Secret12.html" style = "color:#880808;">reason</a>
			to interact with them but, it all changed when the 
			<br>Great Yarin came. As described in the <a href = "YarinMythologyPage.html">Yarinisim page</a>, Yarin came to earth 
			<br>in search of someone who could make him a better show than "Friends", 
			<br>He was fascinated by the lizard people but he understood he could not 
			<img src = "Images/CthuluPageImages/GreatOldOnes4.png" alt = "Image of Nyr'lothar" title = "Nyr'lothar The Great Old One Of The Abyss">
			<br>rule over them when there were other gods on earth. Yarin together with 
			<br>the lizard people went to war against the Great Old Ones, it was a blady 
			<br>war where almost all of the lizard people died but in the end, they won. 
			<br>Atlantis was destroyed and sunk in the sea, never to be found even today. 
			<br>You probably ask "What about the Great Old Ones?" Well, because they 
			<br>are not of our universe Yarin wasn't able to kill them completely but, he 
			<br>did managed to put them into an eternal slumber, never to be waken again.

		<b><h1 id ="cthulhu">Cthulhu</h1></b>
		
		<p>
			Cthulhu was not only one of the Great Old Ones but also the priest of the 
			<br>cult. Cthulhu had millions of followers both from his original universe and 
			<br>from our universe, those followers were the main builders and soldiers of 
			<br>the Great Old Ones but all of them died in the war between the Old Ones 
			<br>and Yarin.
			<br>Not a lot is known about Cthulhu's appearance because it is said that the 
			<br>human brain can't comprehend the appearance of the Great Old Ones, if 
			<br>you ever see an Old One you will either kill yourself or your brain will just 
			<br>explode. After the fall of the Great Old Ones, Cthulhu was the only one 
			<img src = "Images/CthuluPageImages/StatueOfCthulhu.png" alt = "Image of Cthulhu" title = "Statue Of Cthulhu">
			<br>still standing. He took with him all of his followers who were still alive and 
			<br>decided to try one final attack on Yarin but it failed miserably. Cthulhu 
			<br>was defeated, all of his followers died and he was put into an eternal 
			<br>slumber deep in the Pacific Ocean but, without Yarin knowing this wasn't 
			<br>the end of Cthulhu. Cthulhu has many abilities, one of them is entering 
			<br>and controlling people's dreams. With this ability Cthulhu while still 
			<br>sleeping managed to speak with humans through their dreams and lured 
			<br>people into believing in him and creating the Cult Of Cthulhu once more.
			
			<br>throughout the years Cthulhu managed to get more and more people into 
			<img src = "Images/CthuluPageImages/QW.png" alt = "Image of Cthulhu" title = "Wall Carving Of Cthulhu">
			<br>the cult from their dreams, for those of you who know or maybe even 
			<br>dream about "This Man" congratulations, Cthulhu talked with you through 
			<br>your dream.
			<br>As for today, Cthulhu is still in a deep sleep at the bottom of the Pacific 
			<br>Ocean but if the cult will not be stopped soon their mission of awaking 
			<br>Cthulhu will be successful and the fate of our planet will be doomed.

		<b><h1 id ="rituals">Rituals Of The Cult</h1></b>
		<p>
			<img src = "Images/CthuluPageImages/Page1.png" alt = "Rithual" title = "A Page Describing A Ritual">
			After learning about the cult's origins and beliefs I started to think about 
			<br>what rituals And holy practices they may but, but when I asked Ziv about 
			<br>what rituals And holy practices they may but, but when I asked Ziv about 
			<br>it something was different. Ziv didn't answer, and after I asked this he 
			<br>didn't say a word, I tried to ask again I could see in his eyes that the only 
			<br>thing on his mind right now was pure fear, not from me but from what 
			<br>answering this question may do to him. The third time I asked he started 
			<br>to tremble and cry in fear like he was having a PTSD attack, I tried to help 
			<br>him but before I could do anything his eyes started to bleed and he died 
			<br>on the spot. The last thing he said before dying was "Namibia", after some 
			<br>research I found that Nambia is a country in Africa, near Angola and 
			<img src = "Images/CthuluPageImages/Bro.png" alt = "A Rithual" title = "Members Of The Cult Doing A Rithual">
			<br>South Africa, and that Nambia has the largest underground lake in the 
			<br>world, a suitable place for the Cult Of Cthulhu to hide in and so I decided 
			<br>to go there and uncover the thing that Ziv was so afraid of.
			<br>After hours of searching in the lake, I found a small tunnel that seemed 
			<br>out of place, after walking for what felt like eternally if finally found 
			<br>something, a staircase. The staircase led me to a giant room that looked 
			<br>like it was part of an old castle, so old that the walls looked like they had 
			<br>been standing there for eons. The room was full of paintings and statues 
			<br>of a weird monster, it didn't take me long to understand that this strange
            <a href = "DO_NOT_ENTER/Secret14.html"><img src = "Images/CthuluPageImages/C.png" alt = "A cannibalistic Rithual" title = "A Page Describing A Cannibalistic Rithual"></a>			
			<br>monster was supposed to be the god Cthulhu himself but, there was also 
			<br>something floating in the room, the fresh smell of blood. At that exact 
			<br>moment, I knew that I found the right place.
			<br>What I will tell you now will be very disturbing, mainly for me as the 
			<br>trauma of seeing it is still fresh in my mind but it is worth it if this will 
			<br>make you understand how horrific this cult truly is.
			<br>As I was walking in the castle it was very clear that the cult abandoned it 
			<br>years ago but it didn't make the things I saw less disturbing. The castle 	
			<br>was full of torture chambers with every torturing device you can think of 
			<img src = "Images/CthuluPageImages/Page2.png" alt = "A summoning Rithual" title = "A Page Describing How To Summon Ghouls">
			<br>but the real horror started when I found the Sacrifice chambers. 
			<br>They were full of bodies of different animals, dogs cats every animal you 
			<br>can think of was there just lying dead on the floor, and then I found the 
			<br>main chamber. A giant gold statue of Cthulhu was standing in the middle 
			<br>and around it hundreds if not thousands of dead bodies even though they 
			<br>had been dead for years the horrible smell was still covering the entire 
			<br>room.

			<br>well, some of the names you will recognize from history class or the
