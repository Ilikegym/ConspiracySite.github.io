		<p>
			Yarinism is the most ancient religion in the world. There are theories that  
			<br>it existed even before humans or even before Earth itself. Yarinism is also 
			<br>considered the most science-based religion there is, as there are  
			<br>hundreds of archaeological findings that prove the existence of Yarinism.  
			<br>Unlike other religions, Yarinism doesnâ€™t have a holy book or scrolls 
			<br>because Yarinism is such a genius religion that no matter how stupid a  
			<br>person is, at the moment he hears the holy words of the Yarinism god he  
			<br>will forever remember the religion by heart. 
			<br>I spent years searching for the secret to the success of people

			people in general. On one of my many journeys, I found an 
			<br>ancient alien tribe of lizard people in the African country Chad.
			<br>This tribe was practicing the Yarinism religion and 
			<br>from them, I first found out about the truth. To this day, the world is still 
			<br>being controlled by people who believe in the Yarinism god. You can find 
			<br>a detailed list of those people <a href = #list>here</a>.

		<b><h1 id = "Friends">The Creation Story</h1></b>
		<img src = "Images/YarinisimPageImages/YarinCreatingTheUniverse.png" alt = "Image of Yarin creating the universe" title = "Yarin Creating The Universe">
		
		<p>
			In the beginning, there was nothing, nothing but a giant and muscular
			<br>god named Yarin. Yarin was bored so he created the show "Friends" to 
			<br>make his time pass. Yarin watched Friends for hundreds of years, he 
			<br>watched it so much that he was able to finally understand if Ross and 
			<br>Rachel were actually on a break or not, unfortunately, he kept this secret 
			<br>of the universe for himself.  
			<br>After years of watching Friends, Yarin became bored again as he 
			<br>understood it wasn't as good of a show as he thought. As he was thinking 
			<br>about what he could create now, an idea came to his mind, an idea so 
			<br>genius he decided it would be his life mission, to create a show better 
			<img src = "Images/YarinisimPageImages/YarinWatchingTheEarth.png" alt = "Image of Yarin Finding Earth" title = "Yarin Finds Earth">
			<br>than Friends. To create such a show he understood it wouldn't just be a 
			<br>normal show but that he needed to create an entire universe around it, 
			<br>and so our universe was born. After traveling the universe in search of a 
			<br>planet suitable for his show, he found a planet that had the shape of a 
			<br>cube and was full of water, resources, and most importantly lizard people. 
			<br>Yarin loved the lizard people and they loved him, they loved him so much 
			<br>that they created an entire religion around him and this is how Yarinism 
			<br>was born. Yarin knew that the lizard people could create for him the show 
			<br>that he so badly wanted but first, they needed to rule over someone so he 
			<img src = "Images/YarinisimPageImages/YarinWatchingHIMYM.png" alt = "Image of Yarin Watching HIMYM" title = "Yarin Watching HIMYM For The First Time">
			<br>took the creatures from the show 
			<!--Secret link-->
			<a href = "DO_NOT_ENTER/Secret5.html" style = "color:white;">"Friends"</a>
			, the humans, and gave them 
			<br>to the lizard people as slaves. Years passed and the humans with the 
			<br>instructions of the lizard people created "How I Met Your Mother". Yarin 
			<br>saw this show and was shocked, not only it was better than Friends but it 
			<br>was on an entirely different level, Yarin was finally able to rest forever but, 
			<br>as a sign of gratitude he gave his blessing of power and success for all of 
			<br>the creatures that belive in him.

		<img src = "Images/YarinisimPageImages/ImageOfYarin.png" alt = "Image of The Great Yarin" title = "The Great Yarin">
		<p>
			The great Yarin is the all-knowing god of the Yarinism, the one true faith.
			<br>He can take the form of whatever he wants but most of the time he is a 69 
			<br>feet tall muscular russian man. He is so handsome that it is said that one 
			<br>time Sara Netanyahu fell in love only from thinking about his looks.
			<br>Yarin not noly created the universe and the overrated show "Friends",but
			<br>he is also the creator of the healthiest drink in all of the nine realms, 
			<br>vodka. Yarin is also considered to be the greatest teacher of all time as he 
			<br>was the one who taught humans how to use fire, how to peel a tangerine, 
			<br>and most impressive he taught my grandmother how to use the internet.
			<img src = "Images/YarinisimPageImages/YarinTrueForm.png" alt = "Image of Yarin's holy body" title = "Yarin's Holy Body">
			<br>It is said that the great Yarin loves all of his believers, even the poor 
			<br>Asians, but the ones that he loves the most are without a doubt the lizard 
			<br>people and Elon Musk(who is probably a Martian).
			<br>To this day I am trying to find a way to see the great Yarin with my own 
			<br>eyes, there are stories of humans who were so devoted to the faith that 
			<br>Yarin revealed himself to them but, if the greatest lizard man of all time, 
			<br>Ben Gvir himself never saw Yarin why some filthy humans would?

		<a href = "DO_NOT_ENTER/Secret8.html"><img src = "Images/YarinisimPageImages/TheBroCode.png" alt = "Image of the bro code" title = "The Bro Code"></a>
		<p>
			The bro code is a holy set of rules that were written by the great Yarin 
			<br>himself. The rules state the most important things a true Yarinism believer 
			<br>must follow without even questioning them, to this day there was only 
			<br>one lizard man who broke one of the holy rules, this lizard man was 
			<br>sentenced to death and his name was erased from history.
			<br>The rules are:

			<ol type = "I">
				<li><b>Yarin Is The Only God</b></li>
				<li><b>There Is No Woman More Beautiful Than Tzipi Shavit</b></li>
				<img src = "Images/YarinisimPageImages/HIMYM.png" alt = "Image of HIMYM cast" title = "HIMYM Cast Sending A Photo To Yarin">
				<li><b>You Must Always Respect Yarin</b></li>
				<li><b>Remember To Celebrate The HIMYM Day</b></li>

				<li><b>Bros Before Hoes</b></li>
				<li><b>Yarin Is Always Right</b></li>
				<li><b>There Is No Rule Ten</b></li>
			</ol>
		<p>
			The fourth rule that states "Remember To Celebrate The HIMYM Day" 
			<br>refers to the most important and holy day in the Yarinism religion, 19 of 
			<img src = "Images/YarinisimPageImages/PeopleCelebratingHIMYM.png" alt = "Image of people celebrating HIMYM day" title = "People With Suits Celebrating HIMYM Day">
			<br>September.
			<br>On this holy day, Yarin first saw the show "How I Met Your Mother" and 
			<br>fell in love with the show, this moment was so special for Yarin that he 
			<br>decided that on this day there would be a holiday. In fact, HIMYM Day is 
			<br>the only holiday in the entire Yarinism faith. To celebrate this holy day, 
			<br>believers all around the world(and space) come together and watch 
			<br>How I Met Your Mother while wearing their most expensive suits.
			<br>And for the Jewish people who read this page no, you don't get money 
			<br>on this day.

		<p>
			The lizard people were the first creatures on the planet Earth (or 
			<br>"Teraqeylis" in their language) and they were Yarin's favorite species. The 
			<br>lizard people were given the humans by Yarin and they used them as 
			<br>slaves. Today, most people are stupid and are sure that they have free will 
			<br>and do what they want but only the smart ones know that the lizard 
			<br>people are still here, controlling us from the shadows and still using us as 
			<br>slaves.
			<br>The lizard people created Yarinism to worship the great god Yarin, they 
			<br>start each day with a pure 420-kilo protein shake as they believe it makes 
			<br>them closer to the god. Each day they pray 69,420 times each time in a 
			<img src = "Images/YarinisimPageImages/DonaldTrumpLizardMan.jpg" alt = "Image of Lizard Donalnd Trump" title = "Donald Trump True Identity">
			<br>different language because the great Yarin knows all of the 69,420 
			<br>languages of the universe. The holiest lizard man of them all and the head 
			<br>of Yarinism is the legendary lizard man Ben Gvir, it is written that Ben Gvir 
			<br>was one of the 7 original lizards people who created the Yarinism religion,
			<br>the other 6 are

			<br>you are a true truth seeker so here is a fun fact for you: the ending we 
			<br>saw in How I Met Your Mother isn't the real ending, after showing the 
			<br>show to Yarin, the lizard people decided that us, the humans are not 
			<img src = "Images/YarinisimPageImages/LizardMan.png" alt = "Image of a lizard man" title = "Lizard Man">
			<br>worthy to see the true ending of this holy show so they changed it, and to
